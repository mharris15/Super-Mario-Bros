Specific comments on code quality : 

	The first thing I noticed was that this class has the same problem in it's cyclomatic complexity as the level
	loader. This could be changed by seperating the switch function into different groups. This should'nt be a problem
	overall but is bad for code smell. The functionality of the sound seems of and I think the mediaplayer.volume needs
	turned up a little(ofcoarse all systems are different). Given the purpose of this class this code is easy to read
	and seams like a good solution.
