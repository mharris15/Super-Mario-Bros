Specific comments on code quality :

This is my favotie class in this projec because it's the easiest to understand.
I appreciated that keeping tracks of lives and coins are in this code. 
All the methods created in this class are easy to follow and thus easy to implent in other areas of the code.
Some methods are incredible simple, like ExtraLifa and IncreaseScore. 
At first they looked too simple to me, almost as if they were unnecessary. But having them this way made it really
easy to use them in other areas of code, and easy to follow or debug when changes need to be made. Plus the
methods protect varibles like the number of coins and lives from being drastically changed more than 1 at a time.
