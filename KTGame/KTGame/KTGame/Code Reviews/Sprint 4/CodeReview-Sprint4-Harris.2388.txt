Specific comments on code quality :

	Reviewing the score implementation for both items and enemies, I think that there should be a variable for koopa stomp, etc.
	This makes the changes to score easier to read and change. Seeing where the score comes from makes snese and is easy to follow. Adding sounds
	to all enemies and items is similar to the implementation of the score counter. If enemy is stomped make stomped sound. Overall,
	adding sounds and score counter, although it adds lines to the code, does not really increase the complexity of the classes for both 
	enemies and items. Well done and good implementation!
