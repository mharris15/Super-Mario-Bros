Specific comments on code quality :

		To be honest, I had a hard time understanding the reset blinking part of code. The code is simple and clear
		but a bit hard to follow, maybe because there is no comment at all. I don't really get what functionality 
		resetblink and resetdelay have. But it is clear that since we only have limited length of paraxlel, there is
		only one reset position at (44*32+16, 12*32) when player reach X-coordinate of 44*32. But one problem is that 
		there is no calls to change the limit of camera, so the camera would still move back if mario moves back. We
		need to add this feature soon or later.
