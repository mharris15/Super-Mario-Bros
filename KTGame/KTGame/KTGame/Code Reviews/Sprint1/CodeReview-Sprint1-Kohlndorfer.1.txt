Specific comments on code quality :
			
This code is really easy to follow and understand, which I appreciate. 
Right now, the vertical offset for the sprite batch is used repeatedly, and the x values were maunally entered for each new animation.
For this sprint, and probably the rest of the sprints through 4, it'll work perfectly.
However, if we ever want to add another sprite, or change the sprite sheet we use, we would have to go through trial and error to find the new animations.

It was a smart idea to make the direction a boolean instead of having entirely different states of "left idle" or "right idle" or anything like that.
The way its implimented, it still returns the same type of sprite in the state you want, just the sprite coordinates passed into it are changed.
This makes all of the possible states very clear, they are easy to change, and the code is easy to debug.
