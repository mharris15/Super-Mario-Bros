Specific comments on code quality : 

	This Class works well with the current blocks on display and it's pretty easy to follow. I Used the current code to implement
	the pipe sprite currently displayed on screen and had no complications. The sprite sheet it bases its 'XFrame'and 'YFrame' could
	be simplified so only the sprites being used are on the sprite sheet. The naming conventions of the BlockType enum could be
	improved to prevent misunderstanding as well. Overall I think the code is Good and reusable for future sprints.
