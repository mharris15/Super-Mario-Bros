Specific comments on code quality :
			
	This code short, sweet and easy to follow. It follows a similar pattern as the BlockFactory that I implimented which makes our code 
	very maintainable. It might be confusing why numbers like 6 or 7 were used for certain sprites. Overall, this class is very easy to read, follow,
	and implement if I needed to add a new enemy sprite like a paratroopa or a red goomba.
