Specific comments on code quality : 

	This Class works well with the current pipes on display and it's easy to follow and understand. There are four public functions 
	with nothing inside showing 0 reference, which are clearly redundant. I deleted them. The reason these functions are there, I assume,
	is that they are useful in some other concrete block classes and Adam forgot to delete them. Good to see "throw new NotImplementedException();".
	This is the best way to implement the commands which are not meant for this class. Overall I think the code is of good quality and reusable
	for future.
