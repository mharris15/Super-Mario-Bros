Specific comments on code quality :
	Overall, the code seems to work for the current Sprint, but I'm not sure about the implementation 
	for how keys being held down seems to be detecting - I had trouble when I was testing where the key being held
	triggered even when it was not. Additionally, having the entire list of the commands and then having to initialize them
	looks somewhat messy - I'm wondering if there is a way we can clean that up somewhat. Maybe find some way to seperate the concerns
	for command declaration and initialization somewhere else, rather than in the controller?
	In fact, there is surely a better way to do that. The current implementation has up repeat the process in GamePadController.cs.
	Maybe we can declare all that in some kind of class that we can pass into both controllers, rather than doing it seperately in both.
	It'd help if we were to someday implement some other kind of Controller, since we could just re-use the object with the commands in it
	rather than repeating code.
	Additionally, the update method is too complex: Its way too long. We need a more efficient way to do it to reduce the complexity.
