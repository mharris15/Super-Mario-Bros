Specific comments on code quality :
	I think the code here is fantastic. It's easily adaptable based on the XML file, it reads the XML at runtime, and it sends the information from the XML to the game in order
	to build the game as specified. 
	The way you've specified the various entity types and how they will be built is easy to understand and can be easily replicated for any new entity types.
	The only problem I see here is the cyclomatic complexity. Lines 42-157 are one big method. Granted, I still don't really think even this is that big of a deal. We can ask about it later.
	There may be a way to reduce the complexity of that down while maintaining the ease of use of the code.
	Other than that, though, it does what it needs to do and it does it well. I don't really see the point in making any major changes here. Great work!!
