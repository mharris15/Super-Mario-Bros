Specific comments on code quality :
	The first thing I notice was that there's alot going on inside this class making it hard to follow what
	exactly is happening. The program seems to only check for collisions as Block and as Mario and then from there
	deals with the response of item and enemy. This seems like a good way to cut down on the number of checks needed
	but would also prevent enemies from bumping into each other in the future sprints. This could also be a promblem for
	items but i'm not sure how they interact in the game. The next thing I noticed is that ToggleCollisionBox method
	works great when all entities are not moving but falls apart once mario moves. There is also uneeded else statments
	at the end of some methods that don't do anything. Overall I think this is a good start for our game collider but still 
	needs work.
