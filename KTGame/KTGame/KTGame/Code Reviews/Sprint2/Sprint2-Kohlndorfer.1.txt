Specific comments on code quality :

Adding a previous gamepad/keyboard state was a great way to make a distinction between if a keypad was breifly pressed down, or if its being held down.
My only concern is if the game is updating faster than a person releases a button, it might register as being held down rather than it being breifly pressed.
I think adding some kind of wait command could help with this, i.e. if a key is held down for less than 1/4 of a second, it's registerd as a one time click, but for any longer, it registers as it's being held down.
However, this could cause problems, like causing the update command to only run every 1/4 of a second. 
This kind of change could be added later depending on what kind of game controlls we want.

The way the code is written now is easy to understand, and simple to debug if need be.
