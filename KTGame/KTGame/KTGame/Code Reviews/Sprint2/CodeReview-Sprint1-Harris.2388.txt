Specific comments on code quality :
			
	The Enemy object class is really easy to follow and understand. It does everything! Updates the sprites, 
	collison boxes, and positions of every enemy. As we move further in sprints there should be added collison detection with blocks to change direction 
	if an enemy collides with a block. The case of the red koopa, when the red koopa is on the edge of a block, should change direction and not fall off like the green koopa.
	Enemies.cs is really easy to understand as well and would be easy to add a new enemy. I think the only changes to make or consider is the 
	collision rectangle. When looking at the collision blocks for the koopas for example, the block shown is bigger than the actual koopa.
	Tighten up collison boxes is only change to really consider. Both classes are great and easy to read and implement!
