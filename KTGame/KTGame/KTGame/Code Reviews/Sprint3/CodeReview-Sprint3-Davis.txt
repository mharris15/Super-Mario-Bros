Specific comments on code quality : 

		The collsion tracking has improved alot since sprint 3. It now works as a collisder for all entities
		instead of of just Mario and the blocks which is a big improvment. For what I can tell the collider still
		checks a single instance of an entity to all local entites, which could be changed to lower computation
		speed. Overall the code seems great for what I understand of colliders and is simple enough to follow.
