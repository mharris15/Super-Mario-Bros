Specific comments on code quality :

The code for parallax is quite simple - totoal 5 lines. But it works fine and the background texture is beautiful.
Parallax texture is drew before the camera draws things. It move a bit slower than the stage, the reason for which
I don't really know. Overall it's clean and clear.

As for the xml file, the new level design is more complex and better than the one in Sprint2. The file design is 
very "flat", but readable. I personally like the excel graphical design way, which is more obvious and readable. We
can maybe refactor it later.
