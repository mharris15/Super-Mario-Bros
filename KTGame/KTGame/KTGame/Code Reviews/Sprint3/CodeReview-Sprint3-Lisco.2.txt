Specific comments on code quality :
	THe implementation of the Acceleration vector into the player movement is well used here. 
	Specifically, the way the player is able to minutely adjust their position and velocity in the air, 
	and the way the player sprite adjusts to match that is quite good. Additionally, the state transitions 
	associated with entering and exiting the landing state based on how the player is moving are well done. I see no obvious bugs or design 
	flaws here - it all seems pretty simple and functional. The code here meshes well
	with the transitions between the other states, too. Good job!!!!
