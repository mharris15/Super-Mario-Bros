Specific comments on code quality :

The Camera class itself didn't take a lot of user input, because we were given sample code to work off of.

It was very helpful having the camera's position be avalble in the MarioWorld class.
We were able to take advantage of that for checking if enemies were in view before being activated, and the paralax scrolling.
It would be nice if the there were comments or descriptions anywhere about how the numbers of the camera's position could be used.
By that I mean, I had to reach out specifically and ask for the viewport width was and if the x position of the camera was on the left, right, or center.
And going off that, for implementing whether enemies where on screen or not, it would have been more helpful to meto have the x and y position of the camera mean the centre of the screen.
In the Camera code itself, the center of the screen was used by taking viewportwidth/2.
Having that value, adnd the viewport available outside of the Camera class would have been helpful.
