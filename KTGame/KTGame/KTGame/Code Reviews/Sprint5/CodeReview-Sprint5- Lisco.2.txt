Specific comments on code quality :

I think the code here to implement the various enemy behaviors works quite well. Obviously, with enemies like Bowser, Lakitu, and Hammerbros,
they had to implement their own behaviors rather than extending the behaviors shared by goombas/koopas.
THe biggest issue I see is the number of times we check which enemy 'this' is in enemy.cs, rather than overriding methods with custom behaviors in the 
individual enemy classes. However, given poor design choices made in prior sprints and a like of time to refactor, I think the choice to do things this way is
reasonable. There simply wasn't enough time to fix it.

In the future, when custom classes extend abstract ones, more care should be given to keep the code clean and seperated. At this point, the use of custom classes 
honestly wasn't particularly effective. Regardless, this doesn't fall solely on the team members that implemented these new enemies by any means.
