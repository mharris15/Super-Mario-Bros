Specific comments on code quality :

	The first thing I notice with this code is that it's focus seems to be in to many things leading to bad
	code smell ikn this method. The file that affect the camera seem to only be specific to the level currently 
	create making it hard to be used for future levels. A future fix for this could be changing the reset and conditions
	to be part of the input in the xml so that it could be used for future levels. This code seems to be developed to 
	finish the sprint, it is sprint 5 so a patch work understandably will not be resolved.
