Specific comments on code quality :

			The code in Camera class is simple and clean. Although it feels like not right to modify 
			Camera.Position method in such a way, it works quite effiecient. Only thing I felt not proper
			is the number for X position. It is not reusable if any change happens to the game map.
			The xml file is as flat as it always was. It is hard for rest of us to modify the xml file to
			change the position of anything or add or delete anything. But it works for Adam because he 
			is farmiliar with the file format and knows how to layout the map perfectly like the YOU WIN 
			coins in the boss room.
