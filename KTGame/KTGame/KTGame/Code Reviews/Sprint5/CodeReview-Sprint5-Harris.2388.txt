Specific comments on code quality :

	Bowser and Lakitu behavior in game looks like it does what it is supposed to do. Bowser jumps and falls down. We already have 
	methods for both of these actions called FreeFall and Jump, I see that the Y velocity is different though. Maybe we could add a parameter for
	these methods to adjust Y velocity and increase the reusability of our code. Instead of hard coding the values. Other than that I see that 
	the Bowser behvior method does as intended. I see that there is similar code at the end of both Bowser behavior and Lakitu behavior(nextPos,CollisionBox, and Position)
	I am wondering maybe there could be a method that does these tasks and all the behavior methods just call this method. This might help with readability.
	Good job on both of these enemy behavior implementations!
