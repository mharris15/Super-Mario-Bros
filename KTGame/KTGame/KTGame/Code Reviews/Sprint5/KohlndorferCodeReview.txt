Specific comments on code quality :

Originally I had been trying to make projectiles there own enemy. But it was getting to complicated having to activate them and have such drastically different behavoir.
Having Projectiles be there own objects made the game far simpler. This class was obviously taken from the enemy object class and altereted.
This was a quick and effective way to impliment projectiles as they act in many ways similar to enemies.
Having the projectile class made adding projectiles to mario, bowser, lakitu, and Hammerbros relatilvely simple, instead of spending a long time trying to implement each different type of projectile as it's own enemy type.

If we had thought to do this earlier, more time could have been spent making an entirely new design for projectiles instead of making a copy of the enemy design and working from there. 
This would get rid of excess code and created more efficent implementation, instead of looking at projectiles through an enemy lense.
